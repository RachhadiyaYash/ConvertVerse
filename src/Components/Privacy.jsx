      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how ConvertVerse collects, uses, and
        protects the personal information of its users. By using ConvertVerse,
        you consent to the data practices described in this policy.
      </p>
      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We collect personal information such as name, email address, and other
        contact details when you register an account with us or use our
        services. We may also collect usage data, cookies, and other tracking
        technologies to improve our services and analyze user behavior.
      </p>
      <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        We use the collected information to provide and improve our services,
        communicate with you, and personalize your experience. We may also use
        your information for marketing purposes, such as sending promotional
        emails or notifications about new features and updates.
      </p>
      <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        We may share your personal information with trusted third parties to
        provide services on our behalf, or as required by law. We do not sell or
        rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing
        purposes.

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take appropriate measures to protect your personal information from
        unauthorized access and misuse. We use encryption, firewalls, and other
        security technologies to safeguard your data. However, no method of
        transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, so
        we cannot guarantee absolute security.

        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you

        to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Your
        continued use of ConvertVerse after any modifications to this Privacy
        Policy will constitute your acceptance of such changes.
